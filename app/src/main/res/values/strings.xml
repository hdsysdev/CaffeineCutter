    <string name="caffeineInfo1">Caffeine is a stimulant drug, which means it speeds up the messages travelling between the brain and the body.
        While caffeine still hasn’t been included in The National Institute of Drug Abuse’s Commonly Abused Drugs List it certainly does cause some level of addiction.

    <string name="caffeineInfo2">However, those that use caffeine and have tried to
        quit can attest that caffeine causes some degree of both psychological and physiological addiction.
        Caffeine addiction can range from mild to severe and most of the time it is an addiction most people can live a healthy life with.
        This is not the case when dangerous amounts of caffeine are being consumed daily or if caffeine is consumed through sugary beverages,
        which are linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evatt is part of a Johns Hopkins team working on a caffeine dependence treatment program.
        If you want to quit, “I would first recommend becoming aware of how much caffeine you are consuming daily,” Evatt says, adding that many
        people underestimate their use. He advises people against trying to quit caffeine cold turkey. “Withdrawal headaches can last days in some
        individuals,” he says. Instead, cut down slowly to lessen withdrawal symptoms.</string>
